# Making initial inputs

Initial inputs to solution phase lammps files involves putting some number of molecules you are interested in and then put them in a solvent.

- Initial goal is to be able to feed in a base xyz file in to this project, turn it in to a molecule and specify how many of them I would like in the box
- Then I would like to solvate it in tip3p water.

# Running Initial Equilibration Runs

- NVP ensemble
- NVT ensemble
- Check system equilibration
- Bring tmeperature down to near 0K

# Switch to ReaxFF forcefield

I want this to be as easy as specifying a file to look at.

# Data Analysis

I will likely use ben_sci_tools stuff that I have already made for species out data. 

I would also like to zip data for easy transfer.
